# Liquid Galaxy Background Runner
Run a Background for Liquid Galaxy
I designed 10 backgrounds (5 for horizontal setup and 5 for vertical), compressed them and uploaded to my server. The bash script downloads it to a hidden folder, unzips it and runs an Eye of Gnome slideshow in fullscreen on startup.
## Usage Instructions
For vertical:
`$`
For horizontal
`$`
