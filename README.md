# Liquid Galaxy Background Runner
A Liquid Galaxy can be used to run many different applications. Sometimes it's needed to change for one application to another, for example: there is a Liquid Galaxy in a fair and we need to change from Google Earth to Galaxy Pong. As Galaxy Pong and Google Earth are things apart, we must close one to open the other one. Therefore, when you close an application what is left for the user to see is the Ubuntu background. <br>

I designed 10 backgrounds (5 for horizontal setup and 5 for vertical), compressed them and uploaded to my server. The bash script downloads it to a hidden folder, unzips it and runs an Eye of Gnome slideshow in fullscreen on startup.

## Usage Instructions
For vertical:
`$ ./lgbg_vert.sh`<br>
For horizontal:
`$ ./lgbackground.sh`
